## tests run

```shell
python3 comseq.py test/origin-of-species.txt > test/origin-of-species.out
python3 comseq.py test/quick-test.txt test/quick-test-2.txt > test/quick-tests.out
```

## uncertainties

Intended name of evaluating module is uncertain.  Should it be `solution.py`, or is `comseq.py` accceptable?
